# Biostatistics
The Basic Biostatistics concepts and ideas are implied on data sets. Statistical properties of the data is visualized using R packages. From basic biostatistics, Visualization, Probability distribution, Data fitting and hypothesis testing is being covered in this repository.
This module contains some little exercise and assignment provided in the short course Biostatistics from EMBL-EBI.

**Basic**
This module will help to get introduced in R. How to get into basic summary statistics of the data and how to handle the dataframe and manipulate the columns and rows from a structured data has been done here

**Plotting**
This module cover the visualization of the data using **"ggplot"** package of the R. Datasets like *PlantGrowth*, *Mice data*, *ToothGrowth*, *Penguins*, *Diamonds* have been used for visualization. Principle of ggplot module has been learnt. Plots like box plot, violin plot, scatter plot has been done on the datasets using various advanced features like *geom_jitter*, *facet_wrap*.

**Probability Distribution**
This module has covered different data distributions, including *Normal*,*Poisson*,*Binomial*,*Gamma Poisson* or *Negative Binomial*. Sampling of the data following a probability distribution has been done. Small simulation of generating random numbers using a specific probability distributions in R is being done.
